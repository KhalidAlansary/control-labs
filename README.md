## 🤔 What Is `generate_report.py`?

As the name suggests, a python script to generate a report from the lab solutions.

## 📝 How To Use?

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the script with the following command:

```bash
python generate_report.py
```

3. Open the report generated in the `reports` directory and submit!

## ⚡️ Motivation

After I finally finished working on the lab assignment, I found my self repeating the tedious task of copying and pasting code into the report and screenshotting the output.
So instead of wasting precious minutes copying and pasting, I decided to waste hours (if I'm being honest, days..) making a script to automate making report.

## 🌟 Future Plans (who am I kidding, no one is reeding this)

If enough people like this (more than zero), I will work on making the script work for any one by refactoring out my hard coded name, id, and maybe the template.

If you made it this far, thanks, it took me some (too much) time to write this.
